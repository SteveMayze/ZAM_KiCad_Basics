# Introduction to KiCad
## Workshop proposal for ZAM

# OVERVIEW & PURPOSE
The creation of projects in electronics requires the connection of various components to build a circuit. There are various means to achieve this - breadboard, verro-board. However there are many advantages to building an own Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The purpose of this workshop is to introduce the attendees to the KiCad electronic design tool so that they will gain the know-how and confidence to create their own PCBs. This will not be a class in electronics. Knowledge in electronics would be an advantage but not a requirement.

# AUDIENCE
The intended audience are complete newcomers to KiCad. Even to electronics. Current users of KiCad may not gain any further insight into the application or features. Advanced topics like RF interference mitigation will not be covered.
The maximum number of attendees should be limited to 10 in conjunction with the latest ZAM infection protection concepts.
# TIMING
The main part of the workshop would be planned to take place on one day. Two further follow-up workshops could be offered to complete the attendees projects.  The sessions should be as interactive as possible where every 45 minute session is limited to a 20 minute explanation. The remaining 25 minutes is then for attendee practice and questions.
No timing has been allocated for software installation. This would affect the overall time, but it can not be assumed that all attendees will come with KiCad already installed, nor can it be guaranteed that all attendees will have a laptop.
